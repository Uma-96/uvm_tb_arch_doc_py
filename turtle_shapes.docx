Task: 
1)To draw the shapes using Turtle

The major shapes that are needed to construct the Testbench architecture are square and rectangle. Below is the Python script to draw square and rectangle and also connectivity

Steps:
1.Import the turtle library
2.Set the Screen color
3.Instantiate the object for Turtle
4.Set the pen color 
5.Move to the desired location(co-ordinate) to draw the shape 
6.Use begin_fill and end_fill to fill in the shape

Square and rectangle
-------------------------
import turtle
s=turtle.Screen()
s.bgcolor("light blue") #Set the background color of the screen
w = turtle.Turtle()
w.pencolor("black")
w.fillcolor("red")
w.penup()        #Pen up before moving to the desired co-ordinate          
w.goto(-200,50)  #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(-200,50) (x-axis is -200 and y-axis is 50)
w.pendown()      #Pen down to start drawing
w.begin_fill()   #To start filling the color
#To draw a square
for i in range(4):    #Repeat the below steps for 4 times to get the square
 w.forward(100)    #length of the square
 w.left(90)              #Turn toward the left by 90 degree
w.end_fill()           
# To draw rectangle
w.penup()
w.goto(200,50)   #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(200,50)
w.pendown()
w.fillcolor("green")   #Color to fill in the rectangle
w.begin_fill()            #start to fill
for i in range(2):        #Repeat for 2 times to complete the rectangle         
 w.forward(100)         #Length of the rectangle
 w.left(90)                  #Turn left by 90 degree
 w.forward(200)        #Width of the rectangle
 w.left(90)                #Turn left by 90 degree
w.end_fill()
w.hideturtle()   #Hide the turtle pointer


Square inside a square
----------------------------------
import turtle
s=turtle.Screen()
s.bgcolor("light blue")
w = turtle.Turtle()
w.pencolor("black")
w.fillcolor("red")
w.penup()
w.goto(-200,50) #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(-200,50)
w.pendown()
w.begin_fill()
#To draw a square
for i in range(4):  #Repeat the below steps for 4 times to get the square
 w.forward(100)
 w.left(90)
w.penup()
w.goto(-50,0) #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(-50,0) and draw the square 
w.pendown()
#To draw a square
for i in range(4): #Repeat the below steps for 4 times to get the square
 w.left(90)
 w.forward(200)  #Draw a square of length greater than the previous square
w.end_fill()

Task: 
2)To draw the connection between 2 squares and to include text

Steps:
1.Import the turtle library
2.Set the Screen color
3.Instantiate the object for Turtle
4.Set the pen color 
5.Move to the desired location(co-ordinate) to draw the shape 
6.Use begin_fill and end_fill to fill in the shape
7.Move to the centre of the square to draw the arrow head
8.Write the text at the centre of the turtle pointer 


Connecting 2 squares with an arrow head and including text
--------------------------
import turtle
s=turtle.Screen()
s.bgcolor("light blue")
w = turtle.Turtle()
w.pencolor("black")
w.fillcolor("red")
w.penup()
w.goto(-200,0)  #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(-200,0)

w.pendown()
w.begin_fill()
#To draw a square
for i in range(4):  #Repeat the below steps for 4 times to get the square
 w.forward(100)
 w.left(90)
w.penup()
w.goto(100,0)  #To move the turtle to the co-ordinate(100,0)
w.pendown()
#To draw a square
for i in range(4): #Repeat the below steps for 4 times to get the square
 w.forward(100)
 w.left(90)
w.end_fill()
w.penup()
w.goto(-100,50) #Move to the centre of the first square
w.pendown()
w.forward(200) #Draw a arrow line which connects to the second square 

#To draw the arrow head
w.left(45)
w.backward(10)
w.forward(10)
w.right(90)
w.backward(10)

#To write the text
w.penup()
w.goto(0,50) #Move the turtle pointer to the centre of the arrow line to write the text
w.pendown()
w.write("connect",align="center")  #write the text in centre of the turtle pointer                 
w.hideturtle()
